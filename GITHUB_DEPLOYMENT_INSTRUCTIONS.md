# GitHub Deployment Instructions

Your Smart Resume Screener project is ready to be deployed to GitHub. Follow these steps to create a repository and push your code:

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and log in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository: `smart-resume-screener`
4. Set visibility to "Public" (or "Private" if you prefer)
5. **Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license**
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, you need to push your local code to GitHub. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\PIYUSH TORAWANE\Smart resume scanner"
git remote add origin https://github.com/piyushtorawane/smart-resume-screener.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Note: If you're using the default branch name as `master`, use this instead:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## Step 3: Verify the Push

After running the commands, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see all your files uploaded.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:
1. Use GitHub Personal Access Token:
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens
   - Generate a new token with "repo" permissions
   - Use this token instead of your password when prompted

2. If you get "Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind":
   ```bash
   git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Repository Structure

Your repository will contain:
- Backend API server with Node.js/Express
- Database models and services
- Resume parsing functionality
- LLM integration (simulated)
- Single-page HTML application
- Comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps

After successfully pushing to GitHub:
1. Update your README.md with any additional information
2. Consider adding GitHub Actions for CI/CD
3. Add issues and project boards for future enhancements
4. Share your repository with collaborators if needed
