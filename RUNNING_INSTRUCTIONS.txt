The Smart Resume Screener is ready to use with a simulated LLM!

To run the application:

1. THE BACKEND SERVER IS ALREADY RUNNING on http://localhost:3000
   (You can verify this by checking that the health endpoint responds:
    curl http://localhost:3000/api/health)

2. OPEN THE APPLICATION:
   - Open the file "smart_resume_screener.html" in your web browser
   - You can do this by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and choosing "Open with" your browser

3. USING THE APPLICATION:
   - Upload a resume file (PDF or TXT) OR paste resume text in the text area
   - Enter a job description in the job description text area
   - Click "Analyze Match" to see the results
   - View the match score, justification, and matching skills

4. SAMPLE FILES:
   - Try using "sample_resume.txt" or "test_resume.txt" for testing

5. STOPPING THE SERVER (when you're done):
   - Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the server is running

The application is fully functional with the simulated LLM. No additional setup is required!
