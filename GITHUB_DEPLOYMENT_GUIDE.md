## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository: `smart-resume-screener`
4. Set visibility to "Public" (or "Private" if you prefer)
5. **Important**: Leave all checkboxes unchecked (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Deploy Your Code

After creating the repository, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Use the Deployment Script (Recommended)
Double-click on `deploy_to_github.bat` in your project folder

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment
Open a terminal in your project folder and run these commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/piyushtorawane/smart-resume-screener.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

2. You should see all your project files
3. The README.md will render as your project homepage

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
If prompted for credentials:
1. Use your GitHub username
2. For password, use a Personal Access Token:
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens
   - Generate new token with "repo" scope
   - Copy the token and use it as your password

### Repository Not Found Error
This means the repository doesn't exist on GitHub yet. Make sure you've created it first.

### Push Rejected
If you get "Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind":
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push -u origin main
```
